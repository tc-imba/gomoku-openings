# gomoku-openings

**Important: This part is only for reference, you may not dismiss these when developing your own AI.**

Black (the player who makes the first move) was long known to have a big advantage, so we will specify the beginning of the game so that both players will get the same advantage to make the game fair.

We assume the openings are exactly the displayed 5x5 square in the center, x represents black and o represents white, and black always plays in the center on the first step.

The followings are all of the opening situations (on the Judge System):

Other cases (called 妖刀) are abandoned in formal competitions, so we don't consider them.

It's difficult to find English translation for those names of openings, so they are all in Chinese.
